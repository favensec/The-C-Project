# The-C-Project

I will be consistently practicing my C programming language skills. Also will be putting 
gists and tutorials along the way.

# Makefile Tutorial

* One of the primary reasons for using makefile, is to assist in compiling and recompiling of a multi-file program.
  Hence when a linked header file has changed, the source code needs to be recompiled again. Makefiles carry out commands
  as instructed.


gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I

Arguments: 
  -o = Output file.
  -I = Includes directory of header files.
